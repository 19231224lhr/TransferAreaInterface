# Terms of Service

**Effective date: 2026-01-14**

Welcome to **PanguPay**. Please read these Terms carefully before using the service. We aim to keep it formal but clear—your rights and responsibilities are both covered here.

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using PanguPay (including creating/importing accounts, managing addresses, building/submitting transactions, joining organizations, etc.), you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, please stop using the service.

---

## 2. Non-custodial Notice (Important)
PanguPay is a **non-custodial wallet**:
- You control your private key and keep it on your device (optionally encrypted).
- We do not hold your private key and cannot recover your private key or payment password.
- You are responsible for signing and submitting transactions using your private key.

---

## 3. Eligibility and Compliance
You must ensure you are eligible to use the service and comply with applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.  
You must not use PanguPay for illegal, fraudulent, or rights-infringing activities.

---

## 4. Rules of Use and Your Responsibilities
To protect your assets and keep the system stable, you agree to:
- back up your private key and keep backups confidential
- protect your payment password (if encryption is enabled)
- verify recipient address, currency, amount, and mode (Normal/Cross-chain/Pledge) before sending
- avoid importing keys on untrusted or public devices
- not bypass validations or perform abusive requests (e.g. spamming APIs, crafting malicious payloads)

---

## 5. Risk Disclosure
You understand and accept risks including (but not limited to):
- blockchain networks can be unpredictable; transactions may be delayed or fail
- once broadcasted, transactions are usually irreversible
- cross-chain flows involve multiple systems and can carry higher uncertainty
- losses caused by user mistakes (wrong address, key leakage, missing backup, forgotten password) may be unrecoverable

---

## 6. Availability and Changes
We may, without prior notice:
- fix bugs, update features, adjust UI/UX
- temporarily suspend service for maintenance or upgrades

We strive for stability but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.

---

## 7. Fees and Network Costs
PanguPay itself may not charge a software fee, but blockchain transactions may incur network costs (e.g. gas).  
You should review any fee-related prompts and decide whether to proceed.

---

## 8. Prohibited Activities
You must not:
- attempt to steal, infer, or crack other users’ private keys or account data
- exploit vulnerabilities, attack the service, or spam endpoints
- distribute malware/phishing links or trick others into revealing private keys
- engage in activities that violate laws or public order

---

## 9. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- we are not liable for losses caused by blockchain/network outages, node unavailability, or third-party failures
- we are not liable for losses caused by your mistakes (wrong address, leaked key, missing backup, forgotten password)
- we do not guarantee transaction success or confirmation within a specific timeframe

---

## 10. Updates to These Terms
We may update these Terms. The updated version will be published in the docs page with a new effective date. Continuing to use the service means you accept the updated Terms.
