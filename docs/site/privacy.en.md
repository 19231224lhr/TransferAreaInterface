# Privacy Policy

**Effective date: 2026-01-14**

Welcome to **PanguPay**. We take privacy and security seriously. This policy explains—in plain language—what information may be processed when you use PanguPay, why we process it, and what you can do to control it.

> Important: PanguPay is a **non-custodial** wallet. Your private key is used and stored locally (optionally encrypted). We do not upload your private key to any server.

---

## 1. Scope
This policy applies when you access and use the PanguPay web application (wallet, address management, transfers, history, docs, and related features).

---

## 2. What information do we process?
To make it easy to understand, we group data by where it comes from:

### 2.1 Information you provide
When you type or select values in the UI:
- **Private key**: used for local signing. We do not upload it.
- **Recipient address, amount, coin, gas, change address**: used to build and submit transactions (sent to nodes/gateway as required to perform the operation).
- **Organization selections**: joining/choosing a guarantor organization (submitted to the backend to complete the org workflow).

### 2.2 Information stored on your device (LocalStorage / SessionStorage)
To keep the experience smooth across refreshes, PanguPay may store locally:
- language preference (Chinese/English)
- theme preference (light/dark)
- transfer drafts (recipients and advanced options)
- the last opened docs article
- account identifiers and address lists (for display and local management)

> By default, this data stays in your browser. Clearing site data will remove it.

### 2.3 Information generated by network requests
When interacting with blockchain nodes / backend gateway, the infrastructure may log:
- request time, path, response status
- network metadata (e.g. IP address, User-Agent)

Such logs are typically recorded by the node/gateway for operations, debugging, security, or rate-limiting.

---

## 3. How do we use this information?
We only use information for these purposes:
- **To perform your actions**: build, sign, submit transactions; query balances and status.
- **To protect security**: prevent duplicate submissions, avoid double-spend, show validation warnings.
- **To improve UX**: remember language/theme, keep transfer drafts to reduce re-entry.
- **To troubleshoot**: logs can help diagnose issues (private keys are not included).

---

## 4. Do we share your information?
PanguPay does not sell your personal information.

To execute transactions and queries, some information is sent to nodes/gateway (e.g. recipient address, transaction payload, query parameters) so they can:
- broadcast/validate transactions
- query balances/UTXOs/org info
- return transaction status updates

> This is required to provide the service. Private keys are never shared or uploaded.

---

## 5. Your choices and controls
You can manage your privacy at any time:
- **Clear local data**: clear site data in your browser (LocalStorage/SessionStorage/Cookies).
- **Log out / lock screen**: reduce risk on shared devices.
- **Be careful when sharing**: never expose private keys in screenshots, chats, or recordings.

> Clearing local data means you may need to re-import your private key and reset preferences. Data not backed up cannot be recovered.

---

## 6. Security measures
Security features (as implemented in the system) may include:
- local encryption for private keys (e.g. PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM)
- local signing so keys do not leave the device
- multi-layer validation before building transactions (balance, address format, change, gas, etc.)

No system is risk-free. Protecting and backing up your private key remains your responsibility.

---

## 7. Minors
If you are below the legal age in your jurisdiction, please use the service under the supervision of a guardian.

---

## 8. Updates to this policy
We may update this policy to reflect feature changes or compliance needs. The updated policy will be available in the docs page with a new effective date.

---

## 9. Contact
If you have questions about privacy or want to report a security issue, please contact the project maintainers / deployment operator (as announced in your environment).
